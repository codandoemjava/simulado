It represents a single sentence or phrase that users provide to interact with the application.\nIn this case, the utterance \"Which act is playing on the main stage?\" represents a user's question about the scheduled shows at the music festival. By collecting and annotating a variety of utterances like this, the LUIS application can learn to understand user intents and extract relevant entities from the input.\nTo further clarify the other options:\n\n- An intent represents the purpose or goal behind a user's utterance. It captures the user's intention or desired action.\n- A domain refers to a specific area or topic of knowledge, such as music, sports, or weather.\n- An entity represents a specific piece of information or data within an utterance. In this case, an entity could be \"main stage,\" which refers to a specific stage at the music festival.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B. an utterance."

Machine-learning based OCR techniques allow you to extract printed or handwritten text from images, such as posters, street signs and product labels, as well as from documents like articles, reports, forms, and invoices. The text is typically extracted as words, text lines, and paragraphs or text blocks, enabling access to digital version of the scanned text. This eliminates or significantly reduces the need for manual data entry.",

Regression predicts a numeric label or outcome based on variables, or features. For example, an automobile sales company might use the characteristics of a car (such as engine size, number of seats, mileage, and so on) to predict its likely selling price. In this case, the characteristics of the car are the features, and the selling price is the label.",

Fill it with utterances that are outside of your domain.\n\nThe None intent is the fallback intent, and should have 10% of the total utterances. It is important in every app, because it’s used to teach LUIS utterances that are not important in the app domain (subject area). If you do not add any utterances for the None intent, LUIS forces an utterance that is outside the domain into one of the domain intents. This will skew the prediction scores by teaching LUIS the wrong intent for the utterance.\n\nWhen an utterance is predicted as the None intent, the client application can ask more questions or provide a menu to direct the user to valid choices."

Key Phrase Extraction can process the text to identify the main points, these two alone might not be sufficient for a complete AI solution that controls smart devices using verbal commands. it doesn’t necessarily understand the context or the specific actions that need to be taken based on those key phrases. For example, in a command like “Turn on the living room lights”, key phrase extraction might identify “turn on”, “living room”, and “lights” as key phrases, but it doesn’t inherently understand that “turn on” is an action that needs to be applied to the “living room lights”.

It is used to generate text that is similar to the input text. For example, given the text “The cat sat on the”, a language model would predict that the next word is “mat” with a higher probability than “car”.\n\nSince we are talking about a smart device, the answer will be key phrase detection.\n\nUpvote me it makes sense to you.",

This could allow the AI to understand the users' intent and respond appropriately.\nKey phrase extraction could also work but is more complex because an additional layer would have to be added that understands user intent based on the combination of keywords extracted.

Key checks and balances need to make sure that the system's decisions don't discriminate or run a gender, race, sexual orientation, or religion bias toward a group or individual.\n\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/innovate/best-practices/trusted-ai#reliability-and-safety\nAI systems need to be reliable and safe in order to be trusted. It's important for a system to perform as it was originally designed and for it to respond safely to new situations. Its inherent resilience should resist intended or unintended manipulation. Rigorous testing and validation should be established for operating conditions to ensure that the system responds safely to edge cases, and A/B testing and champion/challenger methods should be integrated into the evaluation process."

The first step in building an Azure Machine Learning classification model to identify defective products is to load the dataset. Loading the dataset is necessary to access and analyze the data, as well as to prepare it for model training. Once the dataset is loaded, you can proceed with data preprocessing, including handling missing values, performing feature engineering, and splitting the data into training and testing datasets (option C). Finally, you can create a classification model (option D) using the prepared dataset. However, the initial step is to load the dataset to work with the data effectively."

Regression predicts a numeric label or outcome based on variables, or features. For example, an automobile sales company might use the characteristics of a car (such as engine size, number of seats, mileage, and so on) to predict its likely selling price. In this case, the characteristics of the car are the features, and the selling price is the label.",

The goal is to divide customers into clusters where customers in the same group are more similar to each other than to those in other groups.\n\nRFM segmentation is not a form of Regression, as regression aims to predict a continuous outcome variable from one or more predictor variables.\n\nIt also doesn't fit the definition of Classification, which is a supervised learning approach to predict a categorical outcome.\n\nRegularization is a technique used to prevent overfitting in regression and classification models, and it doesn't apply here as RFM segmentation is not about building a predictive model but rather a descriptive model for customer behavior.",

In this case, the characteristics of the patient are the features, and the label is a binary classification of either 0 or 1, representing non-diabetic or diabetic.",

Regression predicts a numeric label or outcome based on variables, or features. For example, an automobile sales company might use the characteristics of a car (such as engine size, number of seats, mileage, and so on) to predict its likely selling price.

For example, a health clinic might use the characteristics of a patient (such as age, weight, blood pressure, and so on) to predict whether the patient is at risk of diabetes. In this case, the characteristics of the patient are the features, and the label is a binary classification of either 0 or 1, representing non-diabetic or diabetic.",

That statement is True.\nObject detection is a computer vision task that involves identifying and locating objects within an image or video. It can be used to detect multiple types of objects in an image, including damaged products.\nThere are several object detection algorithms and techniques, such as YOLO (You Only Look Once), SSD (Single Shot Detector), and RCNN (Region-based Convolutional Neural Network). These algorithms can be trained to detect various types of objects, including damaged products, in images.\nFor example, a machine learning model trained on images of damaged products can be used to detect and locate defects in manufacturing lines, quality control processes, or customer returns.\nTherefore, the statement \"Object detection can identify multiple types of damaged products in an image\" is true, as it's a computer vision task that can be used for this purpose.",

For example, if an image contains a dog, cat and person, the Detect operation will list those objects with their coordinates in the image. You can use this functionality to process the relationships between the objects in an image. It also lets you determine whether there are multiple instances of the same object in an image.",

This statement is correct. Prioritizing insurance claims based on injuries is a critical task, and ensuring the reliability and safety of the AI system in such cases is essential. It aligns with the reliability and safety principle.\n\nNo. This statement is not an example of the inclusiveness principle.

Machine-learning based OCR techniques allow you to extract printed or handwritten text from images, such as posters, street signs and product labels, as well as from documents like articles, reports, forms, and invoices. The text is typically extracted as words, text lines, and paragraphs or text blocks, enabling access to digital version of the scanned text.

The AI's analysis can then provide feedback to the photographer to improve the composition and settings, resulting in better photographs. While this specific example focuses on photo quality aspects, facial analysis may also involve analyzing and detecting faces within images, recognizing facial expressions, emotions, or attributes, but that doesn't seem to be the focus in this particular case.",

The Detect API detects human faces in an image and returns the rectangle coordinates of their locations. It also returns a unique ID that represents the stored face data. This is used in later operations to identify or verify faces.\n\nOptionally, face detection can extract a set of face-related attributes, such as head pose, age, emotion, facial hair, and glasses. These attributes are general predictions, not actual classifications. Some attributes are useful to ensure that your application is getting high-quality face data when users add themselves to a Face service. For example, your application could advise users to take off their sunglasses if they're wearing sunglasses.",

Named entity recognition involves identifying and classifying specific named entities within text, such as customer orders, support documents, and order status updates. By applying named entity recognition, the chatbot can extract the relevant information from user input and perform the corresponding actions accordingly. Sentiment analysis (A) focuses on analyzing emotions and opinions expressed in text, which is not directly related to the actions described. Translation (C) involves converting text from one language to another, which is not necessary for the described actions. Language modeling (D) involves predicting the next word or phrase in a given context, which is not directly applicable to the described actions either. (Chat GPT)",

I queried again chatgpt about this, here is the answer:\n\"You're right, I apologize for the confusion. In the case where you need to create a chatbot that performs various actions based on user input, the most appropriate type of NLP to use is language modeling (D). Language modeling refers to the ability to understand the meaning and intentions of the user through natural language processing. With language modeling, the chatbot can analyze user input, recognize order requests, retrieve support documentation, and provide order status updates, initiating the corresponding actions based on the information extracted from the textual input.\"",

Here's how it works:\n\nSpeech Recognition: This is the first step, where the audio from the pre-recorded video is converted into text. This process is often handled by Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems, which are a part of NLP.\n\nLanguage Processing: Once the speech is transcribed into text, NLP techniques are used to ensure the text is coherent, contextually appropriate, and segmented correctly for captions.\n\nSynchronization: The transcribed text is then synchronized with the video to create accurate captions that match the timing of the spoken words."

If all the questions were right, MSFT and other companies would have the right to put them down, as it would be ilegal to have the exact same questions with all the right answers from official exams.\n\nSo, this being said, it's fundamental for us to ALWAYS check the Comment section of each question, to see the discussion between the members. Here you'll find the most probable right answers, discussed between the community. That's a percentage of assurance ~99% for the most of the questions, it's not perfect, but it's better than have to shut down the site, got it? :)",

It's important for a system to perform as it was originally designed and for it to respond safely to new situations. Its inherent resilience should resist intended or unintended manipulation. Rigorous testing and validation should be established for operating conditions to ensure that the system responds safely to edge cases, and A/B testing and champion/challenger methods should be integrated into the evaluation process.",

This would primarily involve:\n1. Translation: To convert the content of the manuscripts from various languages to a language the model can understand.\n2. Key Phrase Extraction: To identify and extract the main topics or themes from the manuscript content.\nSo, the correct answer is C. translation and key phrase extraction. Please note that depending on the specific requirements of the solution, other NLP tasks could also be relevant. For example, entity recognition could be used to identify specific entities within the text, and sentiment analysis could be used to understand the tone or sentiment of the manuscript. However, based on the information provided, translation and key phrase extraction are the most directly relevant tasks.\"",

Language\n\nThe Language service, specifically the Natural Language Understanding (NLU) component, is designed to extract meaning and intent from text inputs. It can analyze and understand the user's intent or purpose behind a given statement. By utilizing techniques such as intent recognition and language understanding models, the Language service can identify that the user's intent in the given input is to request a callback at a later time.\n\nAzure Cognitive Search (A) is a service focused on providing full-text search capabilities over structured and unstructured data, but it does not directly handle intent extraction from user inputs.\n\nTranslator (B) is a service that facilitates language translation between different languages, which is not directly related to intent extraction.\n\nSpeech (D) refers to services related to speech recognition and synthesis, focusing on converting spoken language into written text or generating speech from text. While speech recognition may be involved in processing the user input, it is not specific to intent extraction from text inputs.",

This new feature provides additional valuable information that can help the model make better predictions.\n\n Feature Selection Example: If you have a list of features such as house width, length, height, and color, feature selection helps you identify which features have the most impact on predicting the house price. By selecting only the key features (e.g., width and length) and discarding less important ones (e.g., height and color), you reduce the complexity of the model without losing predictive power.",

In Azure Machine Learning, scaling and normalization techniques are applied to facilitate feature engineering. Collectively, these techniques and feature engineering are referred to as featurization.\nNote: Often, features are created from raw data through a process of feature engineering. For example, a time stamp in itself might not be useful for modeling until the information is transformed into units of days, months, or categories that are relevant to the problem, such as holiday versus working day.\n\nBox 3: Feature selection -\nIn machine learning and statistics, feature selection is the process of selecting a subset of relevant, useful features to use in building an analytical model. Feature selection helps narrow the field of data to the most valuable inputs. Narrowing the field of data helps reduce noise and improve training performance.\nReference:\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/studio/evaluate-model-performance https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/concept-automated-ml",

Regression predicts a numeric label or outcome based on variables, or features. For example, an automobile sales company might use the characteristics of a car (such as engine size, number of seats, mileage, and so on) to predict its likely selling price. In this case, the characteristics of the car are the features, and the selling price is the label.",

Regression predicts a numeric label or outcome based on variables, or features. For example, an automobile sales company might use the characteristics of a car (such as engine size, number of seats, mileage, and so on) to predict its likely selling price. In this case, the characteristics of the car are the features, and the selling price is the label.",

Regression predicts a numeric label or outcome based on variables, or features. For example, an automobile sales company might use the characteristics of a car (such as engine size, number of seats, mileage, and so on) to predict its likely selling price. In this case, the characteristics of the car are the features, and the selling price is the label."

It allows data scientists, analysts, and developers to build ML models with high scale, efficiency, and productivity all while sustaining model quality.\n\nBox 2: No -\n\nBox 3: Yes -\nDuring training, Azure Machine Learning creates a number of pipelines in parallel that try different algorithms and parameters for you. The service iterates through\nML algorithms paired with feature selections, where each iteration produces a model with a training score. The higher the score, the better the model is considered to \"fit\" your data. It will stop once it hits the exit criteria defined in the experiment.\n\nBox 4: No -\nApply automated ML when you want Azure Machine Learning to train and tune a model for you using the target metric you specify.\nThe label is the column you want to predict.\nReference:\nhttps://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/machine-learning/automatedml/#features",

This machine learning technique can be applied to binary and multi-class scenarios. For example, a health clinic might use the characteristics of a patient (such as age, weight, blood pressure, and so on) to predict whether the patient is at risk of diabetes. In this case, the characteristics of the patient are the features, and the label is a binary classification of either 0 or 1, representing non-diabetic or diabetic.",

Regression is a technique for predicting continuous outcomes based on the relationship between features and a target variable ⁴. In the case of predicting whether a loan will be repaid or not, the outcome is binary (repaid or not repaid) and not continuous. Therefore, classification would be a more appropriate type of machine learning for this task.\n\nSource: Conversation with Bing, 4/24/2023\n(1) Machine Learning Regression Explained - Seldon. https://www.seldon.io/machine-learning-regression-explained Accessed 4/24/2023.\n(2) . https://bing.com/search?q=regression+machine+learning Accessed 4/24/2023.\n(3) Regression in Machine Learning: What It Is & Examples | Built In. https://builtin.com/data-science/regression-machine-learning Accessed 4/24/2023.\n(4) Machine Learning: Regression | Coursera. https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-regression Accessed 4/24/2023.",

Regression predicts a numeric label or outcome based on variables, or features. For example, an automobile sales company might use the characteristics of a car (such as engine size, number of seats, mileage, and so on) to predict its likely selling price. In this case, the characteristics of the car are the features, and the selling price is the label."

For the third sentence:\nAccuracy is a commonly used metric, especially in binary classification problems, where it measures the percentage of correctly classified instances out of the total. However, in many scenarios, accuracy alone may not provide a comprehensive evaluation of the model's performance, particularly when dealing with imbalanced datasets or when different types of errors have varying degrees of importance.\n\nDifferent evaluation metrics may be more appropriate depending on the problem. For example, in medical diagnostics, sensitivity and specificity (true positive rate and true negative rate) may be more relevant metrics to measure the model's ability to correctly identify positives and negatives. In regression problems, metrics like mean squared error (MSE) or mean absolute error (MAE) are often used.\n\nOther factors, such as precision, recall, F1 score, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC), and others, are commonly used metrics depending on the problem and the desired evaluation criteria.

It is usually the first metric you look at when evaluating a classifier. However, when the test data is unbalanced (where most of the instances belong to one of the classes), or you are more interested in the performance on either one of the classes, accuracy doesn't really capture the effectiveness of a classifier.\nReference:\nhttps://www.cloudfactory.com/data-labeling-guide\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/studio/evaluate-model-performance",

The trained model can then be used to make predictions.\nIncorrect Answers:\n✑ Classification is a machine learning method that uses data to determine the category, type, or class of an item or row of data.\n✑ Clustering, in machine learning, is a method of grouping data points into similar clusters. It is also called segmentation.\nOver the years, many clustering algorithms have been developed. Almost all clustering algorithms use the features of individual items to find similar items. For example, you might apply clustering to find similar people by demographics. You might use clustering with text analysis to group sentences with similar topics or sentiment.\nReference:\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/algorithm-module-reference/linear-regression https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/studio-module-reference/machine-learning-initialize-model-clustering",

Clearly you get a new scan of a new patient and you want to know what that scan shows, you don't have a group of scans to cluster.\n- Clustering gives NO labels. You just get groups and don't know what the label is, but in this question it's very clear they want to know the label that belongs to the new scan -\u003E classification",

Regression predicts a numeric label or outcome based on variables, or features. For example, an automobile sales company might use the characteristics of a car (such as engine size, number of seats, mileage, and so on) to predict its likely selling price. In this case, the characteristics of the car are the features, and the selling price is the label.",

So the answer will be Yes or No. That at the first look is sounding classification. Then it is talking about medical history - which means data is available (and would be labelled). That shows it is supervised; which again indicates that is could be classification (not clustering). But the question doesn't clearly tells whether the data is balanced or not. In true sense, all supervised anomaly at its core are classification but the major difference is the balance of data. Ideally, classification has balanced data so that there can be good distribution of cases between classes (two or more).. but when the data is imbalanced (say 98% vs 2%), then classification becomes difficult and special algorithms are used - such as anomaly detection. Normally medical cases in whole population are generally low compared to healthy. Now debate could be - should all such medical related use cases be used with anomaly algorithm or not? But this question is not answered anywhere."

Automated ML performs model validation as part of training. That is, automated ML uses validation data to tune model hyperparameters based on the applied algorithm to find the best combination that best fits the training data. However, the same validation data is used for each iteration of tuning, which introduces model evaluation bias since the model continues to improve and fit to the validation data.\n\nTo help confirm that such bias isn't applied to the final recommended model, automated ML supports the use of test data to evaluate the final model that automated ML recommends at the end of your experiment. When you provide test data as part of your AutoML experiment configuration, this recommended model is tested by default at the end of your experiment (preview).",

The trained model can then be used to make predictions.\n\nBox 2: Clustering -\nClustering, in machine learning, is a method of grouping data points into similar clusters. It is also called segmentation.\nOver the years, many clustering algorithms have been developed. Almost all clustering algorithms use the features of individual items to find similar items. For example, you might apply clustering to find similar people by demographics. You might use clustering with text analysis to group sentences with similar topics or sentiment.\n\nBox 3: Classification -\nTwo-class classification provides the answer to simple two-choice questions such as Yes/No or True/False.\nReference:\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/studio-module-reference/linear-regression",

These systems should be able to operate as they were originally designed, respond safely to unanticipated conditions, and resist harmful manipulation. It's also important to be able to verify that these systems are behaving as intended under actual operating conditions. How they behave and the variety of conditions they can handle reliably and safely largely reflects the range of situations and circumstances that developers anticipate during design and testing.\nWe believe that rigorous testing is essential during system development and deployment to ensure AI systems can respond safely in unanticipated situations and edge cases, don't have unexpected performance failures, and don't evolve in ways that are inconsistent with original expectations”",

So you are coming from data transformation so data is accurate and the model will be a lot more accurate in predicting. That is not the point for this question. \n\nThis question is about not letting people who use the model predict personal information or private information which was used to train the model in the first place. So putting in missing values or odd values does skew the model prediction and yet at the same time it protect the privacy of the data used to train the model in the first place. \n\nSo answer is privacy and safety.",

It's important for a system to perform as it was originally designed and for it to respond safely to new situations. Its inherent resilience should resist intended or unintended manipulation. Rigorous testing and validation should be established for operating conditions to ensure that the system responds safely to edge cases, and A/B testing and champion/challenger methods should be integrated into the evaluation process.",

The calculated probability of a correct image classification is typically referred to as \"confidence.\"\n\nConfidence represents the level of certainty or probability assigned to a specific classification prediction made by a machine learning model. It indicates the model's belief in the accuracy of its prediction. For example, if a model classifies an image as a dog with a confidence of 0.85, it means the model is 85% confident that the image is correctly classified as a dog.\n\nOn the other hand, accuracy is a metric that measures the overall correctness of the model's predictions. It represents the ratio of correct predictions to the total number of predictions made by the model. Accuracy alone does not provide information about the level of confidence or certainty for individual predictions.",

This process, often called normalization or standardization, prevents features with larger scales from dominating the model's learning process.   \n\ne.g:\nImagine you have a dataset with two features: age (ranging from 18 to 65) and income (ranging from $10,000 to $200,000). Without scaling, the income feature might dominate the model's decision-making process, leading to biased results. By scaling both features to a similar range (e.g., 0 to 1), the model can treat both features equally.",

For example, a health clinic might use the characteristics of a patient (such as age, weight, blood pressure, and so on) to predict whether the patient is at risk of diabetes. In this case, the characteristics of the patient are the features, and the label is a binary classification of either 0 or 1, representing non-diabetic or diabetic.",

Regression predicts a numeric label or outcome based on variables, or features. For example, an automobile sales company might use the characteristics of a car (such as engine size, number of seats, mileage, and so on) to predict its likely selling price. In this case, the characteristics of the car are the features, and the selling price is the label.",

Therefore, to create an anomaly detection model, you prepare training data with all the valid sizes of bottles. If something doesn't fall under the valid ones, will be rejected.\n\nThis scenario is similar to detecting fraudulent transactions, you often don't have enough examples of fraud to train on. But you might have many examples of good transactions. The PCA-Based Anomaly Detection module solves the problem by analyzing available features to determine what constitutes a \"normal\" class. The module then applies distance metrics to identify cases that represent anomalies. This approach lets you train a model by using existing imbalanced data.",

                        "answer_description": "Box 1: Image classification -\nImage classification is a supervised learning problem: define a set of target classes (objects to identify in images), and train a model to recognize them using labeled example photos.\n\nBox 2: Object detection -\nObject detection is a computer vision problem. While closely related to image classification, object detection performs image classification at a more granular scale. Object detection both locates and categorizes entities within images.\n\nBox 3: Semantic Segmentation -\nSemantic segmentation achieves fine-grained inference by making dense predictions inferring labels for every pixel, so that each pixel is labeled with the class of its enclosing object ore region.\nReference:\nhttps://developers.google.com/machine-learning/practica/image-classification https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/machine-learning/tutorials/object-detection-model-builder https://nanonets.com/blog/how-to-do-semantic-segmentation-using-deep-learning/",

This is useful for doing a face search by image.\n\nTwo working modes, matchPerson and matchFace, are supported. The matchPerson mode returns similar faces after filtering for the same person by using the Verify API. The matchFace mode ignores the same-person filter. It returns a list of similar candidate faces that may or may not belong to the same person.\n\n~Face grouping:\nThe Group API divides a set of unknown faces into several groups based on similarity. Each group is a disjoint proper subset of the original set of faces. All of the faces in a group are likely to belong to the same person. There can be several different groups for a single person. The groups are differentiated by another factor, such as expression, for example.",

For example, if an image contains a dog, cat and person, the Detect operation will list those objects together with their coordinates in the image. You can use this functionality to process the relationships between the objects in an image. It also lets you determine whether there are multiple instances of the same tag in an image.\nThe Detect API applies tags based on the objects or living things identified in the image. There is currently no formal relationship between the tagging taxonomy and the object detection taxonomy. At a conceptual level, the Detect API only finds objects and living things, while the Tag API can also include contextual terms like \"indoor\", which can't be localized with bounding boxes.\nReference:\nhttps://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/face/ https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/computer-vision/concept-object-detection",

An image classifier is an AI service that applies labels (which represent classes) to images, according to their visual characteristics. Unlike the Computer Vision service, Custom Vision allows you to specify the labels to apply.\nNote: The Custom Vision service uses a machine learning algorithm to apply labels to images. You, the developer, must submit groups of images that feature and lack the characteristics in question. You label the images yourself at the time of submission. Then the algorithm trains to this data and calculates its own accuracy by testing itself on those same images. Once the algorithm is trained, you can test, retrain, and eventually use it to classify new images according to the needs of your app. You can also export the model itself for offline use.\nIncorrect Answers:\nComputer Vision:\nAzure's Computer Vision service provides developers with access to advanced algorithms that process images and return information based on the visual features you're interested in. For example, Computer Vision can determine whether an image contains adult content, find specific brands or objects, or find human faces.\nReference:\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/custom-vision-service/home",

This API provides powerful image analysis algorithms that can recognize various objects, people, and scenes in the images. With this API, you can extract rich visual features from the images, including tags, descriptions, and categories. These features can be used to automatically tag the images with relevant keywords and descriptions, which can make it easier to search and organize the images.\n\nNote that the Computer Vision API uses machine learning algorithms to recognize the objects and scenes in the images, and it can improve its accuracy over time as it learns from more data.

These systems should be able to operate as they were originally designed, respond safely to unanticipated conditions, and resist harmful manipulation.\n\nBox 2: Accountability -\nThe people who design and deploy AI systems must be accountable for how their systems operate. Organizations should draw upon industry standards to develop accountability norms. These norms can ensure that AI systems are not the final authority on any decision that impacts people's lives and that humans maintain meaningful control over otherwise highly autonomous AI systems.\n\nBox 3: Privacy and security -\nAs AI becomes more prevalent, protecting privacy and securing important personal and business information is becoming more critical and complex. With AI, privacy and data security issues require especially close attention because access to data is essential for AI systems to make accurate and informed predictions and decisions about people. AI systems must comply with privacy laws that require transparency about the collection, use, and storage of data and mandate that consumers have appropriate controls to choose how their data is used\nReference:\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/responsible-ai-principles/4-guiding-principles",

The matchPerson mode returns similar faces after filtering for the same person by using the Verify API. The matchFace mode ignores the same-person filter. It returns a list of similar candidate faces that may or may not belong to the same person.\n\nBox 3: identification -\nFace identification can address \"one-to-many\" matching of one face in an image to a set of faces in a secure repository. Match candidates are returned based on how closely their face data matches the query face. This scenario is used in granting building or airport access to a certain group of people or verifying the user of a device.\nReference:\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/face/overview",
