It captures the user's intention or desired action.\n- A domain refers to a specific area or topic of knowledge, such as music, sports, or weather.\n- An entity represents a specific piece of information or data within an utterance.

For example, in a command like “Turn on the living room lights”, key phrase extraction might identify “turn on”, “living room”, and “lights” as key phrases, but it doesn’t inherently understand that “turn on” is an action that needs to be applied to the “living room lights”.

This principle is even more important when AI systems are being developed. Key checks and balances need to make sure that the system's decisions don't discriminate or run a gender, race, sexual orientation, or religion bias toward a group or individual.\n\nhttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/innovate/best-practices/trusted-ai#reliability-and-safety\nAI systems need to be reliable and safe in order to be trusted. It's important for a system to perform as it was originally designed and for it to respond safely to new situations. Its inherent resilience should resist intended or unintended manipulation. Rigorous testing and validation should be established for operating conditions to ensure that the system responds safely to edge cases, and A/B testing and champion/challenger methods should be integrated into the evaluation process."

Prepare data: Identify the features and label in a dataset. Pre-process, or clean and transform, the data as needed.\n2. Train model: Split the data into two groups, a training and a validation set.\n3. Evaluate performance: Compare how close the model's predictions are to the known labels.\n4. Deploy a predictive service: After you train a machine learning model, you need to convert the training pipeline into a real-time inference pipeline.",

Regression predicts a numeric label or outcome based on variables, or features. For example, an automobile sales company might use the characteristics of a car (such as engine size, number of seats, mileage, and so on) to predict its likely selling price. In this case, the characteristics of the car are the features, and the selling price is the label.",

The Detect API pinpoints human faces in images, providing their location and a unique ID. Additionally, it can estimate attributes like head pose, age, emotion, facial hair, and glasses. These attributes, though approximate, can improve user experience, for instance, by suggesting users remove sunglasses for better face recognition.",

The Detect API detects human faces in an image and returns the rectangle coordinates of their locations. It also returns a unique ID that represents the stored face data. This is used in later operations to identify or verify faces.\n\nOptionally, face detection can extract a set of face-related attributes, such as head pose, age, emotion, facial hair, and glasses. These attributes are general predictions, not actual classifications. Some attributes are useful to ensure that your application is getting high-quality face data when users add themselves to a Face service. For example, your application could advise users to take off their sunglasses if they're wearing sunglasses.",

When you register a model, it creates a versioned entry in the model registry, which helps you keep track of different iterations or improvements made to the model over time. This allows for easy deployment, reproducibility, and management of different versions of the trained model.",

In this case, you can train a Custom Vision object detection model using the 1,000 digital photos of the widgets. By labeling the widgets in the images and providing corresponding bounding boxes, the model can learn to identify and locate the widgets in new photos.\n\nComputer Vision Spatial Analysis focuses on analyzing the spatial relationships and layout of objects within an image, which might not be suitable for precisely identifying the location of specific objects like widgets.\n\nComputer Vision Image Analysis is a broad term that encompasses various image analysis techniques, but it may not provide the specific object detection capability required for locating widgets.\n\nCustom Vision classification is used to classify images into predefined categories rather than detecting the location of specific objects within the images.",

Named entity recognition involves identifying and classifying specific named entities within text, such as customer orders, support documents, and order status updates. By applying named entity recognition, the chatbot can extract the relevant information from user input and perform the corresponding actions accordingly. Sentiment analysis (A) focuses on analyzing emotions and opinions expressed in text, which is not directly related to the actions described. Translation (C) involves converting text from one language to another, which is not necessary for the described actions. Language modeling (D) involves predicting the next word or phrase in a given context, which is not directly applicable to the described actions either. (Chat GPT)",

As far as i knows Language Modeling is the service that is able to understand user input and generate actions consequently. I queried again chatgpt about this, here is the answer:\n\"You're right, I apologize for the confusion. In the case where you need to create a chatbot that performs various actions based on user input, the most appropriate type of NLP to use is language modeling (D). Language modeling refers to the ability to understand the meaning and intentions of the user through natural language processing. With language modeling, the chatbot can analyze user input, recognize order requests, retrieve support documentation, and provide order status updates, initiating the corresponding actions based on the information extracted from the textual input.\"",

It's important for a system to perform as it was originally designed and for it to respond safely to new situations. Its inherent resilience should resist intended or unintended manipulation. Rigorous testing and validation should be established for operating conditions to ensure that the system responds safely to edge cases, and A/B testing and champion/challenger methods should be integrated into the evaluation process.",

The people who design and deploy the AI system need to be accountable for its actions and decisions, especially as we progress toward more autonomous systems. Organizations should consider establishing an internal review body that provides oversight, insights, and guidance about developing and deploying AI systems. While this guidance might vary depending on the company and region, it should reflect an organization's AI journey.",

This would primarily involve:\n1. Translation: To convert the content of the manuscripts from various languages to a language the model can understand.\n2. Key Phrase Extraction: To identify and extract the main topics or themes from the manuscript content.\nSo, the correct answer is C. translation and key phrase extraction. Please note that depending on the specific requirements of the solution, other NLP tasks could also be relevant. For example, entity recognition could be used to identify specific entities within the text, and sentiment analysis could be used to understand the tone or sentiment of the manuscript. However, based on the information provided, translation and key phrase extraction are the most directly relevant tasks.\"",

Language\n\nThe Language service, specifically the Natural Language Understanding (NLU) component, is designed to extract meaning and intent from text inputs. It can analyze and understand the user's intent or purpose behind a given statement. By utilizing techniques such as intent recognition and language understanding models, the Language service can identify that the user's intent in the given input is to request a callback at a later time.\n\nAzure Cognitive Search (A) is a service focused on providing full-text search capabilities over structured and unstructured data, but it does not directly handle intent extraction from user inputs.\n\nTranslator (B) is a service that facilitates language translation between different languages, which is not directly related to intent extraction.\n\nSpeech (D) refers to services related to speech recognition and synthesis, focusing on converting spoken language into written text or generating speech from text. While speech recognition may be involved in processing the user input, it is not specific to intent extraction from text inputs.",

This new feature provides additional valuable information that can help the model make better predictions.\n\n Feature Selection Example: If you have a list of features such as house width, length, height, and color, feature selection helps you identify which features have the most impact on predicting the house price. By selecting only the key features (e.g., width and length) and discarding less important ones (e.g., height and color), you reduce the complexity of the model without losing predictive power.",

In Azure Machine Learning, scaling and normalization techniques are applied to facilitate feature engineering. Collectively, these techniques and feature engineering are referred to as featurization.\nNote: Often, features are created from raw data through a process of feature engineering. For example, a time stamp in itself might not be useful for modeling until the information is transformed into units of days, months, or categories that are relevant to the problem, such as holiday versus working day.\n\nBox 3: Feature selection -\nIn machine learning and statistics, feature selection is the process of selecting a subset of relevant, useful features to use in building an analytical model. Feature selection helps narrow the field of data to the most valuable inputs. Narrowing the field of data helps reduce noise and improve training performance.\nReference:\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/studio/evaluate-model-performance https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/concept-automated-ml",

Regression predicts a numeric label or outcome based on variables, or features. For example, an automobile sales company might use the characteristics of a car (such as engine size, number of seats, mileage, and so on) to predict its likely selling price. In this case, the characteristics of the car are the features, and the selling price is the label.",

Regression predicts a numeric label or outcome based on variables, or features. For example, an automobile sales company might use the characteristics of a car (such as engine size, number of seats, mileage, and so on) to predict its likely selling price. In this case, the characteristics of the car are the features, and the selling price is the label."

Regression predicts a numeric label or outcome based on variables, or features. For example, an automobile sales company might use the characteristics of a car (such as engine size, number of seats, mileage, and so on) to predict its likely selling price. In this case, the characteristics of the car are the features, and the selling price is the label.",

Regression predicts a numeric label or outcome based on variables, or features. For example, an automobile sales company might use the characteristics of a car (such as engine size, number of seats, mileage, and so on) to predict its likely selling price. In this case, the characteristics of the car are the features, and the selling price is the label.",

It allows data scientists, analysts, and developers to build ML models with high scale, efficiency, and productivity all while sustaining model quality.\n\nBox 2: No -\n\nBox 3: Yes -\nDuring training, Azure Machine Learning creates a number of pipelines in parallel that try different algorithms and parameters for you. The service iterates through\nML algorithms paired with feature selections, where each iteration produces a model with a training score. The higher the score, the better the model is considered to \"fit\" your data. It will stop once it hits the exit criteria defined in the experiment.\n\nBox 4: No -\nApply automated ML when you want Azure Machine Learning to train and tune a model for you using the target metric you specify.\nThe label is the column you want to predict.\nReference:\nhttps://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/machine-learning/automatedml/#features",

For the third sentence:\nAccuracy is a commonly used metric, especially in binary classification problems, where it measures the percentage of correctly classified instances out of the total. However, in many scenarios, accuracy alone may not provide a comprehensive evaluation of the model's performance, particularly when dealing with imbalanced datasets or when different types of errors have varying degrees of importance.\n\nDifferent evaluation metrics may be more appropriate depending on the problem. For example, in medical diagnostics, sensitivity and specificity (true positive rate and true negative rate) may be more relevant metrics to measure the model's ability to correctly identify positives and negatives. In regression problems, metrics like mean squared error (MSE) or mean absolute error (MAE) are often used.\n\nOther factors, such as precision, recall, F1 score, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC), and others, are commonly used metrics depending on the problem and the desired evaluation criteria.

Clearly you get a new scan of a new patient and you want to know what that scan shows, you don't have a group of scans to cluster.\n- Clustering gives NO labels.

Regression predicts a numeric label or outcome based on variables, or features. For example, an automobile sales company might use the characteristics of a car (such as engine size, number of seats, mileage, and so on) to predict its likely selling price. In this case, the characteristics of the car are the features, and the selling price is the label.",

For example, K-means clustering algorithms assign similar data points into groups, where the K value represents the size of the grouping and granularity. This technique is helpful for market segmentation, image compression, etc.\n\nhttps://www.ibm.com/cloud/blog/supervised-vs-unsupervised-learning",

So the answer will be Yes or No. That at the first look is sounding classification. Then it is talking about medical history - which means data is available (and would be labelled). That shows it is supervised; which again indicates that is could be classification (not clustering). But the question doesn't clearly tells whether the data is balanced or not. In true sense, all supervised anomaly at its core are classification but the major difference is the balance of data. Ideally, classification has balanced data so that there can be good distribution of cases between classes (two or more).. but when the data is imbalanced (say 98% vs 2%), then classification becomes difficult and special algorithms are used - such as anomaly detection. Normally medical cases in whole population are generally low compared to healthy. Now debate could be - should all such medical related use cases be used with anomaly algorithm or not? But this question is not answered anywhere."

Automated ML performs model validation as part of training. That is, automated ML uses validation data to tune model hyperparameters based on the applied algorithm to find the best combination that best fits the training data. However, the same validation data is used for each iteration of tuning, which introduces model evaluation bias since the model continues to improve and fit to the validation data.\n\nTo help confirm that such bias isn't applied to the final recommended model, automated ML supports the use of test data to evaluate the final model that automated ML recommends at the end of your experiment. When you provide test data as part of your AutoML experiment configuration, this recommended model is tested by default at the end of your experiment (preview).",

It is a common metric for evaluating regression models.\nExplanation: Balanced accuracy is a classification metric used to handle imbalanced datasets. It calculates the average of recall obtained on each class.\nRelevance: Not applicable to regression.\nConclusion:\nFor evaluating a regression model, the correct metrics are:\n\nR² (Coefficient of Determination)\nRMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)",

The trained model can then be used to make predictions.\n\nBox 2: Clustering -\nClustering, in machine learning, is a method of grouping data points into similar clusters. It is also called segmentation.\nOver the years, many clustering algorithms have been developed. Almost all clustering algorithms use the features of individual items to find similar items. For example, you might apply clustering to find similar people by demographics. You might use clustering with text analysis to group sentences with similar topics or sentiment.\n\nBox 3: Classification -\nTwo-class classification provides the answer to simple two-choice questions such as Yes/No or True/False.\nReference:\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/studio-module-reference/linear-regression",

Indeed you could use classification algorithm, however you need to know before hand the allocated group the customers. In most cases we dont, so we used unsupervised learning \n3d one: It is Classification. As you can regard this yes or no question. Now it could be done by regression if you are using the grade as a dependent variable, however the clear cut here is in the question where it says \"whether\". If it was a regression, the question will be giving clear hints of a continuous variable (grade) as the target to check for the student. Cheers",

This machine learning technique can be applied to binary and multi-class scenarios. For example, a health clinic might use the characteristics of a patient (such as age, weight, blood pressure, and so on) to predict whether the patient is at risk of diabetes. In this case, the characteristics of the patient are the features, and the label is a binary classification of either 0 or 1, representing non-diabetic or diabetic.",

Clustering is an unsupervised learning technique that doesn't require predefined labels. It groups data based on similarity without using known labels.\n--For a classification model, labels must be numeric.\nYes. This statement is generally accurate. In a classification model, the labels represent different classes or categories, and they are typically assigned numeric values (e.g., 0, 1, 2) to represent the classes. However, in some cases, categorical labels may also be used, but they are often encoded into numeric values for modeling.",

Therefore, to create an anomaly detection model, you prepare training data with all the valid sizes of bottles. If something doesn't fall under the valid ones, will be rejected.\n\nThis scenario is similar to detecting fraudulent transactions, you often don't have enough examples of fraud to train on. But you might have many examples of good transactions. The PCA-Based Anomaly Detection module solves the problem by analyzing available features to determine what constitutes a \"normal\" class. The module then applies distance metrics to identify cases that represent anomalies. This approach lets you train a model by using existing imbalanced data.",

Object detection is similar, but it also returns the coordinates in the image where the applied label(s) can be found.\n\nBox 2: Yes -\nThe Custom Vision service uses a machine learning algorithm to analyze images. You, the developer, submit groups of images that feature and lack the characteristics in question. You label the images yourself at the time of submission. Then, the algorithm trains to this data and calculates its own accuracy by testing itself on those same images.\n\nBox 3: No -\nCustom Vision service can be used only on graphic files.\nReference:\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/Custom-Vision-Service/overview",

While closely related to image classification, object detection performs image classification at a more granular scale. Object detection both locates and categorizes entities within images.\n\nBox 3: Semantic Segmentation -\nSemantic segmentation achieves fine-grained inference by making dense predictions inferring labels for every pixel, so that each pixel is labeled with the class of its enclosing object ore region.\nReference:\nhttps://developers.google.com/machine-learning/practica/image-classification https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/machine-learning/tutorials/object-detection-model-builder https://nanonets.com/blog/how-to-do-semantic-segmentation-using-deep-learning/",

Each group is a disjoint proper subset of the original set of faces. All of the faces in a group are likely to belong to the same person. There can be several different groups for a single person.

For example, if an image contains a dog, cat and person, the Detect operation will list those objects together with their coordinates in the image. You can use this functionality to process the relationships between the objects in an image. It also lets you determine whether there are multiple instances of the same tag in an image.\nThe Detect API applies tags based on the objects or living things identified in the image. There is currently no formal relationship between the tagging taxonomy and the object detection taxonomy. At a conceptual level, the Detect API only finds objects and living things, while the Tag API can also include contextual terms like \"indoor\", which can't be localized with bounding boxes.\nReference:\nhttps://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/face/ https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/computer-vision/concept-object-detection",

This API provides powerful image analysis algorithms that can recognize various objects, people, and scenes in the images. With this API, you can extract rich visual features from the images, including tags, descriptions, and categories. These features can be used to automatically tag the images with relevant keywords and descriptions, which can make it easier to search and organize the images.\n\nNote that the Computer Vision API uses machine learning algorithms to recognize the objects and scenes in the images, and it can improve its accuracy over time as it learns from more data. Therefore, it is a great choice for building an image tagging solution that can automatically recognize and tag images of your friends.",

These systems should be able to operate as they were originally designed, respond safely to unanticipated conditions, and resist harmful manipulation.\n\nBox 2: Accountability -\nThe people who design and deploy AI systems must be accountable for how their systems operate. Organizations should draw upon industry standards to develop accountability norms. These norms can ensure that AI systems are not the final authority on any decision that impacts people's lives and that humans maintain meaningful control over otherwise highly autonomous AI systems.\n\nBox 3: Privacy and security -\nAs AI becomes more prevalent, protecting privacy and securing important personal and business information is becoming more critical and complex. With AI, privacy and data security issues require especially close attention because access to data is essential for AI systems to make accurate and informed predictions and decisions about people. AI systems must comply with privacy laws that require transparency about the collection, use, and storage of data and mandate that consumers have appropriate controls to choose how their data is used\nReference:\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/responsible-ai-principles/4-guiding-principles",

The matchPerson mode returns similar faces after filtering for the same person by using the Verify API. The matchFace mode ignores the same-person filter. It returns a list of similar candidate faces that may or may not belong to the same person.\n\nBox 3: identification -\nFace identification can address \"one-to-many\" matching of one face in an image to a set of faces in a secure repository. Match candidates are returned based on how closely their face data matches the query face. This scenario is used in granting building or airport access to a certain group of people or verifying the user of a device.\nReference:\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/face/overview",
